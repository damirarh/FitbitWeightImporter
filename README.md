# Fitbit Weight Importer

Simple tool for batch importing weight data from a CSV file into Fitbit.

The tool uses the same API as the Fitbit web dashboard. Before using it, a weight entry must added from the browser to capture the authentication header and copy it into the application source code. Since it's a one-off tool, a bunch of other data is hardcoded in class fields as well.
